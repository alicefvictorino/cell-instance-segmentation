        "3.  **Data Acquisition**: Downloads and unzips the dataset from Kaggle into the Colab environment.\n",
        "4.  **Preprocessing**: Runs the `preprocess.py` script to convert annotations to YOLO format.\n",
        "5.  **Model Training**: Executes a training run to improve the model (`yolov11s-seg` for 50 epochs).\n",
        "6.  **Save Results**: Copies the final trained model and results to your personal Google Drive for permanent storage."
